# Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX-Final

This project is a simple decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The DApp allows users to increment, decrement, reset, and retrieve a count value, which is displayed dynamically on the frontend.

## Description


The Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX-Final project demonstrates basic interaction with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract, written in Solidity, manages a counter that can be incremented, decremented, reset, and queried. The DApp frontend provides a user interface to interact with this smart contract, updating the count value in real-time.

## Getting Started

Installing


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX-Final.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX-Final


Install the necessary dependencies:

Modify configuration files if necessary to connect to your Ethereum network (e.g., update truffle-config.js or hardhat.config.js).

Start the frontend application:

npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the DApp.
